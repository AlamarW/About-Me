# About Me
My name is Austin Wiggins and I am a transitioning service member who has spent their career learning both Turkish and Korean as an Air Force translator. I've spent the last 5 years of my military career as a User Experience designer, leading various software and policy projects. Now that I am transitioning out of the Air Force, I want to be closer to the making of software products and am looking for employment as a software engineer or data engineer.

# Education
I've learned two foreign languages (Korean and Turkish) with associates degrees from the Defense Langauge Institute. I have a bachelors in Innovation and Society from Arizona State University, and will be finishing up my masters in Public Interest Technology by the end of the year. I have a certificate from IBM in Data Engineering and in Backend Development.

# Experience
I've spent 9 months as a data engineer on a data scientist team for the federal government in 2019 where I learned python and about RDBMSs. I've largely self-studied aside from that.
