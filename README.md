# About Me
My name is Austin Wiggins "Alamar" and I'm a transitioning service member looking for a job in software engineering. My interests are in backend development and data engineering.

# Education
I've learned two foreign languages (Korean and Turkish) with associates degrees from the Defense Langauge Institute. I have a bachelors in Innovation and Society from Arizona State University, and will be finishing up my masters in Public Interest Technology by the end of the year.

# Experience
I've spent 10 months as a data engineer on a data scientist team for the federal government a few years back where I learned python and about rudimentary RDBMSs. I've largely self-studied aside from that.
