# About Me
I'm Austin Wiggins. I'm transitioning from Active Duty Air Force with experience as both a translator in Turkish and Korean and as a User Experience Designer and Researcher. I'm looking for roles as a software engineer for once I complete my software engineering internship.

# Education
I've learned two foreign languages (Korean and Turkish) with associates degrees from the Defense Langauge Institute. I have a bachelors in Innovation and Society from Arizona State University, and a Masters of Science in Public Interest Technology. I have two certificates from IBM in Backed Development and Data Engineering. I consider acquiring new skills one of my strong suits and can quickly ramp up with any tech needed.

# Experience
I've spent a year as a data engineer, and am going through a 6-month software engineering internship at a scheduling company named Duality Systems
