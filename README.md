# About Me
My name is Austin Lamar Wiggins and I “develop” under the moniker Alamar. I’m a hobbyist developer developer with a keen interest in language processing and machine learning. 

# Education
My education has a smattering of things. I have two associate degrees in Korean and Turkish that capped off my time at one of the world’s most prestigious foreign language acquisition centers. Currently I am working on a bachelor’s degree in Information Technology with a concentration in programming. Since I have a full-time job and a family to support, the degree progress is slow-going, so I take to learning programming on my own to fill the time.

# Experience
Though I’ve tried to pick up programming at various points in my life, I didn’t actually start in earnest until mid-2019. Which means I was in my mid-twenties when I started to program in earnest.

# Projects
- NovLib: a simple application that let’s do Mad Libs-like text swapping with classic texts (like Alice in Wonderland)
- A myriad web scrapers
