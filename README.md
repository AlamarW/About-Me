# About Me
My name is Austin Lamar Wiggins and I “develop” under the moniker AlamarW. I’m a hobbyist developer with an interest in most things backend and language processing. 

# Education
I have knowledge in a smattering of things. I have two associate degrees in Korean and Turkish that capped off my time at one of the world’s most prestigious foreign language acquisition centers, the Defense Langauge Institute Foreign Language Center, in Monterey, CA. I use my time away from work to pursue two seperate hobbies. Art and programming. 

# Experience
Though I’ve tried to pick up programming at various points in my life, I didn’t actually start in earnest until mid-2019. I spent 6 months between mid-to-late 2019, working as a data analyst, using python to analyze data with the Air Force

# Projects
- NovLib: a simple application that let’s do Mad Libs-like text swapping with classic texts (like Alice in Wonderland)
- A myriad web scrapers
- Twitter Sentiment Analysis tools
- Quaint RSS Feed Reader: a very simple CLI RSS Feed Reader
